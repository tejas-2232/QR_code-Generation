# QR_code-Generation
QR codes are some of the fastest-growing trends in today’s world when it comes to sharing any sort of information.
    A QR code is simply a square picture that is cluttered with white and black boxes of different shapes and sizes. This arrangement of boxes is what allows the information to be stored in a simple picture. This piece of code is machine-readable through the help of a camera.
    What usually happens is that the QR code is scanned by the camera through a specific application that has a concern with QR code we are scanning. 
    The application accesses the phone’s camera to take a picture of the code and the resulting picture is then analyzed by the application which allows information to be extracted.
    
Q: Where are QR codes used?
A:   The QR code technology originated in 1994 from Japan where it was used in the automotive industry. The need for the QR code came from being unable to store large amounts of information in the standard barcode that we still see today. From there, the QR code gained rapid popularity and saw its use being adopted in all sorts of industries all over the world.
     Whenever an event is about to happen, it is advertised through various different means. Those means are often posters
splattered across towns and online advertisements. These ads now contain a QR code that we can scan that takes us to the events page.
     The page could be located on either Facebook or have its own website. We will simply pull up our phones and scan the code and end up on the exact page we would want to look up.
      Locks have also started to incorporate this technology in various different ways. One of the simplest out there is used for cycle locks. The lock can be unlocked simply by scanning the QR code available on it. 
      The app that exists for such locks makes sure that the user which is scanning the lock is the actual owner of the bicycle too. 
      It won’t just unlock from anyone’s phone even if they have the app. This shows us that QR codes are very secure as well.
